Task description
----------------
Write an ansible playbook, that performs the following tasks:

- builds a new docker image using a Dockerfile you provide (please use this base image from hub.docker.com: centos:7)
      - the new image should have:
          - all recent system updates
          - nginx installed and running
          - nginx should serve at /index.html a simple html page only containing the timestamp of time when the file was created
- starts the new image (port 80 should be reachable from the outside)

The expectation is, that we can run the playbook and then easily can reach the html page inside the running container on port 80


Technical requirements
----------------------
Please provide *one* zip file that contains the following:
- playbook, dockerfile
- documentation how to start the playbook and access the aforementioned html page
